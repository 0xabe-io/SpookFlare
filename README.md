SpookFlare has a different perspective to bypass security measures and it gives you the opportunity to bypass the endpoint countermeasures at the client-side detection and network-side detection. SpookFlare is a loader generator for Meterpreter Reverse HTTP and HTTPS stages. SpookFlare has custom encrypter with string obfuscation and run-time code compilation features so you can bypass the countermeasures of the target systems like a boss until they “learn” the technique and behavior of SpookFlare payloads.

* Obfuscation
* Runtime Code Compiling
* Source Code Encryption
* Patched Meterpreter Stage Support

    [*] You can use "help" command for access help section.

    spookflare > help

    list     : List payloads
    generate : Generate payloads
    exit     : Exit from program

    [!] Important: Use x86 listener for x86 payloads and x64 listener for x64 payloads otherwise the process will crash!

    spookflare > list

    SpookFlare can generate following payloads.

    [*]  Meterpreter Loader (.EXE) with Custom Encrypter and Custom Stub:

        - Meterpreter Reverse HTTP x86/x64
        - Meterpreter Reverse HTTPS x86/x64
```
